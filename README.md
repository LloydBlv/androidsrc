# Huh

Most Google Android code is "open source", but unfortunately it can be hard to find and browse the latest sources online. This page aims to fix that! Next time you're looking for sources, come here first! This page is community managed. Please [open issues](https://github.com/pyricau/androidsrc/issues/new) if a library is missing, or better yet open a pull request! I picked the first default GitHub Jekyll theme, fill free to open a PR with a better theme / style.
