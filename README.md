# Welcome 👋

## 👋 What's this?

Developers write better apps when they can [read the source](https://blog.codinghorror.com/learn-to-read-the-source-luke/). Unfortunately, the sources for the Android framework and various Google Android libraries are scattered all over the web.

This pages aims to help developers find the sources they're looking for.

## Can I help? 

You can improve this page and help the Android community by opening [an issue](https://github.com/pyricau/androidsrc/issues/new) or [a pull request](https://github.com/pyricau/androidsrc/edit/main/README.md) 🙏.
